# Installing Online Chess Enhancement Suite in Chrome

The extension isn't published on Chrome Web Store, but it is possible to install and use it with Chrome.

To install the extension, go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/klausweiss/online-chess-enhancement-suite/releases) and download the zip prefixed with `chrome_`.
It should be available in the **Assets** section of the release you want to install.

Once you download and unzip the extension the steps are as follows:

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
1. Toggle developer mode in the top right corner
1. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder

That's it. All the steps above are shown e.g. in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oswjtLwCUqg).
