A web browser extension that allows to use keyboard and mouse to move pieces on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).
To move a piece, point the mouse cursor to the square that you would like to move to and press a key corresponding to a type of piece which sould be moved there.

Shoutout to [Lichess-Keyboard-Input](https://github.com/Sentero-esp12/Lichess-Keyboard-Input) for the original idea.
It differs from the original extension in that all pieces of the same kind are controlled using the same key.

## Usage

You need to be able to move pieces by clicking on a piece and on the destination square on lichess (as opposed to only allowing movement by dragging)
and you are good to go. The controls are shortly described in the [tutorial](./docs/TUTORIAL.md).
