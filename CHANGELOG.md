# Changelog

## [0.3] - 2021-11-28

**Breaking changes:**
- From now on, after a missclick you will need to confirm the move, even when only one piece is able to make the move to the selected square.
This behavior can be customized in the extension preferences.
**The old behavior with automatically performing the only move is still possible, turn it on in the extension preferences.**
It's also possible to ignore missclicks altogether.

Other changes:
- Tutorial and preferences can handle browser preference for dark mode.
- Relevant changes are shown after update.
